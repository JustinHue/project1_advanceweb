		<h2>Who am I?</h2>

<p>Hi! I am Justin Hellsten. I would be what you call a hobbyist programmer. On my spare time I love to work on personal projects or learn something new in programming. Most of my projects revolve mostly around making and designing games or webites, but I am open to working on projects in other areas. I am currently a student studying at Georgian College for the Computer Programming Analyst program and working in co-ops between academic semesters through Georgian College's internship program.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about my projects you can check out my portfolio page or view the source code on Github. If you're an employer you can check out my skills, expertise and work experience on my Linkedin profile.</p>
